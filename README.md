This is an unofficial Deezer addon for Kodi.  
It works **only for premium account** (Deezer doesn't allow streaming from free accounts).
Right now this addon works only for family accounts, personal accounts support will be added soon.
It supports access to your playlists. Searching for tracks, albums and artists is also implemented.
It does not allow for browsing the chart and radio at the moment but it may be implemented in the future.
It plays the .mp3 tracks in 128kb resolution only as that's the max available bitrate for TV's from Deezer.


# Installation
* Download the [latest release zip file](https://github.com/lorkadiscovery/plugin.audio.deezer/archive/master.zip) 
* Move it to your kodi box.
* Install it by selecting `'Install from zip file'` in the addon menu.

### Compatibility
This addon is compatible Kodi 19 Matrix

# Limitations
Since Deezer API doesn't give profiles for family accounts, the workaround include asking for followings of the main account.
So if you follow anyone on Deezer, they will appear on your family profiles.
